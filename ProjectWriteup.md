Max Harrington

Metis Linear Regression Module Project Proposal 

July 28th, 2021

## Question/Need:

Every year, U.S. students are saddled with billions of dollars of student loan debt for undergraduate degrees. As the costs of these degrees skyrockets, their inherent value is called into question. Prospective high school students, their parents, and schools themselves all have a stake in a fair price for education.

The goal of this project is to identify the relative value of a particular college based on various metrics provided by the schools.

## Data Description:

The data for this project will be scraped from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System within the National Center for Education Statistics, provided by the US Department of Education. The link can be found here: https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/
