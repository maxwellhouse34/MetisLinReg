The goal of this project is to understand the factors that lead to college tuition price, and use those factors to accurately predict school tuition.

To start exploring this goal, I made a pairplot exploring the most unique and cleanest features. I have 45 main features, but will end up with about 90-100; several of the variables have multiple parts (ethnicity), and others require dummy variables that need calculation.

Initially, the pair plot demonstrates some interesting connections. While difficult to read with this many variables, it appears that feature engineering will be not only useful but essential, as many of the key relationships donâ€™t follow a clear linear pattern. 
I was also intrigued to see variables that I expected to be directly correlated (ex. tution and room/board) have more variation than anticipated, which makes me hopeful that this model will not be simply attributable to a handful of features.
